macserial
=========

Obtains and decodes Mac serial number and board identifier to provide more information about the production of your hardware. Works as a decent companion to [Apple Check Coverage](https://checkcoverage.apple.com) and [Apple Specs](http://support-sp.apple.com/sp/index?page=cpuspec&cc=HTD5) portal. Check the [format description](https://github.com/vit9696/MacSerial/blob/master/FORMAT.md) for more details.

Should be built with a compiler supporting C11. Prebuilt binaries are available for macOS 10.4 and higher.

Run with `-h` argument to see all available arguments.
